# Tutorial

## Required Dependencies
* Linux-based computer, server, or cluster.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Data source
For this tutorial, we'll be using the RNA-Seq data generated by [Yu et al 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580720308856?via%3Dihub). In this work, they report that Messenger RNA 5â€² NAD+ capping is a dynamic regulatory epitranscriptome mark that is required for proper response to abscisic acid in Arabidopsis. A graphic abstract is shown below:

## Pulling HAMRLINC Docker Image
To run HAMRLINC, you need to first pull the docker image for the pipeline to your computer. If you are not familiar with container technology and would like to learn the basics, please check out [CyVerse Container & Cloud Native Camp Documentation](https://cc.cyverse.org/). It is open source and free. Dig in!

Pull HAMRLINC docker image. This should take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.
```
docker pull chosenobih/hamrlinc:v0.1
```
After building the conatiner, run the code below to be sure that you now have the image on your computer
```
docker image ls
```
Your ouput should be similar to the image below:
